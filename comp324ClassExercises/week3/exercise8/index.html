            <p><b>Algebra</b> often deals with the rate of change concept (slope)<br>We usually visualize it using stairs to enhance the concept of rise over run</p>

                <p>Aside from slope, Algebra introduces the idea behind the unknown. While scary at first, it helps one develop the understanding that not everything can be accounted for.<br><b>Especially in Math....</b></p>

                <p>Coincidentally, these functions are also used to develop lines that we can get the slope from. We call these: Linear Functions <br> And they look like this: <br><b>y = mx + b</b></p>
                <p>Y is known as the y-axis coordinate, M is the slope of the line, X is the x-axis coordinate, and B is the y-intercept (where the line crosses the y-axis)</p>
